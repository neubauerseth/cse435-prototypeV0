# cse435-prototypeV0

This is my CSE 435 Protoype V0 Assignment

I was tasked with recreating Scenario 1 and 2 which are: 

- **Scenario One**:
  - The ADB system operates effectively on a straight highway at night, with no other vehicles present. Demonstrate the full high-beam illumination.

- **Scenario Two**:
  - The system adjusts the beam pattern when an oncoming vehicle is detected, ensuring no glare while maintaining maximum illumination on other road areas.
